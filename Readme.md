### üîë **How It Works**

  - Client sends a POST request with the long URL

    POST /create
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "url": "https://domain.com/very/long/path"
    }

  - Server validates the URL
    - Checks if the URL starts with "https://"
    - Rejects invalid or malformed URLs

  - Server generates a short key
    - Uses SHA256 to hash the original URL
    - Encodes the hash using Base64
    - Example: "abc123"

  - Server stores the mapping
    Original URL  --->  Short Key
    "https://domain.com/very/long/path"  --->  "abc123"

  - Server returns the short URL

    {
      "short-url": "https://domain.com/abc123"
    }

  - When user visits the short URL
    GET /abc123  --->  Redirects to the original long URL
